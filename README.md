# Yol-Arkadasim-Golang

Yol-Arkadasim is a platform inspired by BlaBlaCar, designed to help users find travel companions for both city and intercity trips. This project is built using modern technologies like **Next.js**, **TailwindCSS**, **MongoDB**, **Go**, **Gin**, and **Axios**.

The application allows drivers to share empty seats in their vehicles and passengers to reserve these seats for their journeys. Users can create ads for the routes they plan to travel or apply to existing ads.

## Technologies

- **Next.js**: A modern frontend framework based on React.
- **TailwindCSS**: Used for fast and flexible CSS design.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for managing data.
- **Go**: Used to build the backend API.
- **Gin**: A lightweight HTTP web framework for Go.
- **Axios**: Used for data exchange between frontend and backend.
